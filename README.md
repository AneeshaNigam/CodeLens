# CodeLens – AI-Powered Code Reviewer

CodeLens is an AI-based code review tool that analyzes JavaScript code and provides structured feedback similar to what a senior developer would deliver. It identifies bugs, performance issues, best-practice violations, security concerns, and readability improvements. The project is built using React, Node.js/Express, and Google Gemini.

## Features

- Live code editor with syntax highlighting
- AI-generated code reviews using Gemini
- Senior code reviewer system prompt for detailed feedback
- Markdown rendering for clear output presentation
- Dark and light theme toggle with persistence
- Modular backend architecture: Routes, Controllers, Services

## How It Works

1. User enters code into the editor.
2. Frontend sends a POST request to the backend endpoint `/ai/get-review`.
3. The controller validates the input and forwards it to the service.
4. The service communicates with the Gemini model using a structured system instruction.
5. Gemini returns a detailed review.
6. The frontend displays the review in markdown format.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- react-simple-code-editor
- PrismJS
- React Markdown
- Axios

### Backend
- Node.js
- Express
- Google Generative AI SDK
- CORS

## Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd codelens
```

### 2. Backend setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:
```
GOOGLE_GEMINI_KEY=your_api_key
PORT=5000
```

Start the backend:
```bash
npm start
```

### 3. Frontend setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Ensure that Axios in the frontend points to the correct backend port:
```js
axios.post("http://localhost:5000/ai/get-review", { code })
```

## API Endpoint

### POST /ai/get-review
Request:
```json
{
  "code": "function sum(a, b) { return a + b; }"
}
```

Response:
- AI-generated review text in markdown format.

## UI Features

- Syntax-highlighted editor
- Split screen layout for editor and review
- Dark and light mode support
- Markdown-rendered feedback

## Future Enhancements

- Support for multiple programming languages
- Automatic code fixes generated by the model
- Code quality scoring
- Version comparison
- Extension for editors such as VS Code
